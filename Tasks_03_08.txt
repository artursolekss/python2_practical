MongoDB:
  1)Take one of the previous SQL databases created by you
  2)In Python, write the code which extracts the tables from that DB
  3)Load the data from these tables as the collections to MongoDB collections (create them before)
  3.1) Create unique index, so it matches the key value in the initial SQL database
  4)Insert at least 3 entries to these collections
  5)Perform at least 3 selections based on different (MIXED - "one or another","one and another", etc.) filter
  6)Perform at least 3 update operations
Redis DB:
  1)Use the same SQL data as in Part 1.
  2)Create Redis DB, with the data from SQL:
    Set a key with a specific value in Redis.
    Retrieve the value of a key from Redis.
    Delete a key-value pair from Redis.
